# Micro Expression Recognition Using Python

## Overview
This project implements a micro-expression recognition system using Python. It utilizes the FER-2013 dataset for training and includes a real-time expression recognition module. The system can detect various micro-expressions to provide insights into human emotions.

## Features
- **Real-time Expression Recognition**: A `main.py` file that leverages a webcam feed for detecting micro-expressions.
- **FER-2013 Dataset Utilization**: Preprocessed and trained on data from Kaggle's FER-2013 dataset.
- **Jupyter Notebook for Experimentation**: Contains the training process, data visualization, and detailed analysis.
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**: Uses Python libraries like TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and others.
